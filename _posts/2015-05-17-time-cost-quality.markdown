The [Project management triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) claims you can have only two out of the following three: __cost__, __time__ and __quality__. I cut a paper toy so you can play this game during a boring meeting:

The toy is cut from stock paper (110 lb, 300 g/m2), each wheel is made of seven layers of paper.
The colors are red, orange and yellow.

Dimensions: `5.5" x 5.5" x 0.2"` (`14cm x 14cm x 0.5cm`).

The paper is strong enough so that you can stand it in vertical position as well.

You can get the paper toy from my [Etsy shop]().
