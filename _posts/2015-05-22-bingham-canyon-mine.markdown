[Bingham Canyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_Canyon_Mine) is a copper mine located in Utah. It is one of the largest man--made holes in the world ([map of the area](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/40.5336/-112.1625&layers=C)).

Here is aerial photo of the mine and below is the model, both oriented the same direction:

The model is quite small (8cm x 8cm) and easily fits into hand:

The arrow on topmost layer is direction towards north.
Model scale is 1:50 000.

Each paper layer corresponds to 20 meters of elevation. Each fifth layer has pink color, thus elevation diff between two pink papers is 100 metres. Elevation of the lowest pink paper is 1500m and the highest one is 2100m above sea level:

I gathered the elevation lines via [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net/), exported the outcome to SVG, prepared the layers for cutting in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and cut the paper layers using Silhouette blade cutter.
