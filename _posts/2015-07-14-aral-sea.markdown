During the last 60 years [Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea) has almost completely dryed up. This shrinking is considered to be "one of the planet's worst environmental disasters".

I took the surface outlines of Aral Sea [from past 60 years](http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article115.html) and combined them together into a single 3D paper cube:

[Here is data visualization focused on Central Asia](http://www.grida.no/graphicslib/collection/central-asia-environment-and-development-graphics) which features the shrinking Aral Sea as well and provides more information on the region (thanks to Nickola√Ø). The original data and maps of the shrinking Aral Sea were prepared in late 1990s by the visualisation team of UNEP / GRID-Arendal in Norway in collaboration with KyrGIS cartographic laboratory in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
