Employing the same technique as with the [PoÄ¾ana volcano](https://petervojtek.github.io/diy/2015/04/18/3d-paper-model-of-polana-volcano.html) I created 3D model of Mt. Everest:

More photos are below.
You can [buy the model from my Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/230547170/mt-everest-3d-paper-model).

The model is oriented to west, so that when looking from front size, you see Nepalian-side base camp, [Khumbu glacier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu_Glacier) and [South Col](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Col). North-direction indicator is present on the base paper.

The model scale is `1:100.000`, so that `1 cm` on paper corresponds to `1 km` in reality in terms of latitude and longitude. The elevation zoom factor is `2x` (`1:50.000`), so that `1 cm` of elevation corresponds to `500 metres` of altitude. 

The area captured by the model is visible on the map below:
