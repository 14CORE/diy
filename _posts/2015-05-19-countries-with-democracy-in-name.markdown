I took [List of sovereign states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states) and picked those states which keep word "democratic" in their full name. Then I took the [Democracy Index list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_index_by_country_.282014.29) and joined it to the first list.

Here is the outcome (sorted alphabetically):

| State                 | Full Name                                    | Democracy Rank | Category             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Algeria               | People's Democratic Republic of Algeria      | 117/167        | Authoritarian regime |
| DR Congo              | Democratic Republic of the Congo             | 162/167        | Authoritarian regime |
| North Korea           | Democratic People's Republic of Korea        | 167/167        | Authoritarian regime |
| East Timor            | Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste           | 46/167         | Flawed democracy     |
| Ethiopia              | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia      | 124/167        | Authoritarian regime |
| Laos                  | Lao People's Democratic Republic             | 157/167        | Authoritarian regime |
| Nepal                 | Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal         | 105/167        | Hybrid regime        |
| Western Sahara        | Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic             | N/A            |                      |
| São Tomé and Príncipe | Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe | N/A            |                      |
| Sri Lanka             | Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka   | 87/167         | Hybrid regime        |


Not a single _democractic_ state (by its name) listed in Democracy index list made it to the category Full democracy as defined by [Democracy index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_index_by_country_.282014.29).
