[Jazero Počúvadlo](http://www.banskastiavnica.sk/visitor/unesco-1/technical-monuments.html) (literally _Listening lake_) is located in central Slovakia in [Štiavnica Mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0tiavnica_Mountains) ([map](http://goo.gl/RPBhcj)).

Lake title is located on south side. Model scale is 1:20000.

The lake is artificial and its construction started in [1775](http://www.banskastiavnica.sk/navstevnik/banicke-dedicstvo-a-historia/technicke-zaujimavosti/tajchy/tajch-pocuvadlo.html). Lake Počúvadlo served as a water resource for gold and silver mines.

The lake is a curiosity due to its dams -- there are dams both on the south and on the north side of the lake (majority of artificial lakes have only a single dam). Following detail depicts unique location of the lake. If all its dams would dissapear at the same moment, the lake water will flow into two valleys.
