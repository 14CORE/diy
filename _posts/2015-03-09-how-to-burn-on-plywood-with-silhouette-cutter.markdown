Before you insert plywood into Silhouette feeder, use a brush to remove wooden dust from plywood surface, otherwise your Silhouette internals will quickly cover with dust.

### Plywood Thickness Up To 1mm -- Without Cutting Mat

Silhouette feeder is originally designed for materials thick up to 1mm. If you are burning into plywood which is 1mm thick or less, you can insert the plywood directly into the feeder without using a cutting mat. __You may damage your Silhouette if you try to insert plywood thicker than 1mm this way.__

__Plywood must be wide enough so that the white plastic feeding wheels will catch the plywood (at least 21cm)__ -- the black rubber wheels themselves are not fixed to the rotating spindle and thus provide only vertical downforce.

This cutting--mat_--less_ approach has one disadvantage -- the pair of white feeding wheels will leave a trace on the plywood:

If you want to avoid the traces of feeding wheels on your plywood, you can use the approach below.

### Plywood Thickness Up To 2mm -- With Cutting Mat

You need to use some supplying mat and your plywood __cannot be wider than 20 cm so that it is not caught by the white feeding wheels__ -- the point is the plywood will pass only under the black rubber feeding wheels which provide up to 2mm vertical space:

I do not recommend you to use new sticky cutting mat as its stickiness will quickly wear out due to the dust present on plywood surface and this mat will no longer be sticky enough to be used for regular paper/mylar cutting.

I use an old abandoned cutting mat for the purpose, but you can actually use any piece of strong paper as mat and put few small drops of superglue which will keep the plywood fixed to the mat:

Do not try use plywood thicker than 2mm -- there is not enough space under the metal strip which is used as guiding rail for the left--right movement of the cutting/burning head. 

### Focusing the Laser

If the laser focal point is not set properly, the laser beam will make no effect to the plywood.
I set proper laser focal point in following way:

1. Start burning and press pause button immediately once the laser beam is above the plywood surface.
2. Manually press the laser to its _low_ position so that the laser beam is burning.
3. If you see smoke coming out of the plywood, the laser focus is set properly:

Otherwise, rotate the upper part of the laser in clockwise or counterclockwise direction to alter the laser beam focal point:

### Traversing the Same Path Twice

Silhouette is precise enough to traverse the same path twice so that the burned path is somehow bolder, however I found it easier and less time consuming to invest more time to properly adjust the laser focal point and pass the path only once.

Following image is [Vápenná mountain in Malé Karpaty](http://goo.gl/SXC2AJ), laser traversed the whole image path twice:

For a comparison, this house was burned with a single path traversal:
