Most of the [Horseshoe Bend photos](https://www.google.sk/search?q=horseshoe+bend+colorado+river&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1278&bih=945&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=5Oc1VbnHHIOnsAGSpIO4BA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) along with the photo above are shot with wide--angle lens which results into impression that the bend is much wider than is the reality.

North-direction indicator is present on the base paper.
The model scale is `1:28.000` so that `1 cm` on paper corresponds to `280 metres`.
