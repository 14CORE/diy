Most of the [Horseshoe Bend photos](https://www.google.sk/search?q=horseshoe+bend+colorado+river&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1278&bih=945&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=5Oc1VbnHHIOnsAGSpIO4BA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) along with the photo above are shot with wide--angle lens which results into impression that the bend is much wider than is the reality.

North-direction indicator is present on the base paper.
The model scale is `1:28.000` so that `1 cm` on paper corresponds to `280 metres`. 

The area captured by the model is visible on the map below:

## Assembly Instructions

No glue is used and no tools are required, the model is assembled by your bare hands.

Take the red base paper and place is on a table so that the "N" (North) sigh is in front of you and the north arrow (triangle) points towards right:

Straighten the three vertical ribs:

There are 24 beige papers, each has a small number from 2 to 24. Only the beige paper No. 1 is without number -- that is the paper with text "GRAND Canyon".

Take the paper No. 24 a put it into the last position so that the number "24" is in front of you.
The beige papers should fit easily into the red base paper, do not apply force.
