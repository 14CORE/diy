I like [picNYC TABLE](http://haikocornelissen.com/work/picnyc-table/) project but the plates and glass are put directly on the soil which is far from flat and thus beverage coasters are required.

On our balcony I employed different approach to avoid the beverage coasters and the outcome is following:

The pot with soil is located below the platform (desk). The desk is made of performed metal sheet:
