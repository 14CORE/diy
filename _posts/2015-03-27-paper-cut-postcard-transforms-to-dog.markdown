We use [Silhouette blade cutter](http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop) to create a postcard which (after successful delivery) can be transformed into a self--standing dog.
We will also create a custom stamp which will indicate the folding instructions for the recipient.

This is how the postcard looks when delivered:

Now the recipient will take the part of the postcard shaped as bone and transforms the postcard into a self--standing U--shape to emphasize dog's ears, eyes, paws and tail:

The _bone_ is visible in this rear view:

The curves depicting dog's ears, eyes, paws and the bone are intentionally not being cut entirely to survive the postal delivery without harm and can be easily separated later by hand:

The rear side of the postcard includes assembly instructions:

The assembly instructions are applied using stamp from rubber foam (I am not sure what is the proper name of the material -- in Slovak it is called [_moss rubber_](http://www.hobby-kreativ.sk/hobby-kreativ/eshop/40-1-MACHOVA-GUMA)).

To create the stamp, [I replace the Silhouette's cutting blade with a laser](https://petervojtek.github.io/diy/2015/03/02/how-to-replace-silhouette-blade-with-laser.html) and engrave assembly instructions into the rubber:

If you don't have a blade cutter to cut the postcard, you can order the postcards from my [etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/227791931/2-paper-cut-postcards-transformable-into).
