I use notebook with external display, wireless keyboard and mouse and my table is organized this way:

![Minimal Working Desk With Each Unnecessary Item Put Under Table]({{site.baseurl}}/images/desk-01.jpg "Minimal Working Desk With Each Unnecessary Item Put Under Table")

The laptop is located below the desk along with all the cables. On the right side of the photo is also place for the keyboard:

![Laptop below desk]({{site.baseurl}}/images/desk-02.jpg "Laptop below desk")

Light is provided by a warm color LED stripe attached to the bottom edge of the external display:

When idle, I put the laptop into sleep mode. To wake the computer up, I move a mouse or press a keyboard key.
