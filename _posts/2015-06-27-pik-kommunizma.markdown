[Ismoil Somoni Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismoil_Somoni_Peak) (7495 m) is located in Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan. Prior to year 1998 the peak was named Pik Kommunizma (literally Communism Peak) and this former name remains in common use and is broadly recognized.

The nail pointing with sharp tip upwards is tribute to an old--fashioned [issue tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) employed in communist Czechoslovakian shops to collect papers with finished orders. E.g., in butcher shop the customer order was written on a piece of paper, then the goods (piece of meat) was issued, the customer paid and finally the shop assistant put the sheet of paper on such a nail. At the end of the business day there were many papers layered on the nail.
