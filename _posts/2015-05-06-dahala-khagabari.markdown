[Dahala Khagabari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahala_Khagrabari) is the only third--order [enclave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave) in the world. According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahala_Khagrabari), it is __piece of India within Bangladesh, within India, within Bangladesh.__

I created a paper model to visualize this part of Indo--Bangladesh borderline. 
Red paper belongs to Bangladesh, beige paper is Indian land.

The colored papers are layered to emphasizes how deeply is Dahala Khagabari embedded and do not correspond to elevation of the terrain (which is actually almost flat):

The paper model corresponds to following area:

The large Bangladeshi area on the left side is the main part of the state territory. However, the Indian area on the right side is actually a 1st level enclave. The main Indian territory is at least 10km away from the enclave and thus out of our paper model scale. If you zoom out the map, you will see a pink line which connects the Dahala Khagabari enclave with the main Indian territory (the line is just my guess, not sure if it is the shortest distance).

I used [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net/), [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) data and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) to create SVG for [paper cutting machine](http://www.amazon.com/Silhouette-SILHOUETTE-PORTRAIT-Portrait/dp/B009GZUPFA). [The SVG for cutting is here on github]().
