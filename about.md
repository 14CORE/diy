My name is Peter. I was posting remarks and experiences from my DIY projects on [a github page](https://github.com/petervojtek/diy) which become quite popular. Later I realized I miss there discussion and advanced content control, and I established this blog which runs on [Jekyll engine](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I post some art--related content on [behance](https://www.behance.net/petervojtek), [deviantart](http://petervojtek.deviantart.com/) and [pinterest](pinterest.com/tangocut/).

Here is my [github page](https://github.com/petervojtek) and here is my [linkedin profile](http://sk.linkedin.com/pub/peter-vojtek/12/9b9/197).
